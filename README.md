# MvvmLoginDemo
This demo basically is using MVVM with LiveData Data Binding.
MVVM was invented by Microsoft architects Ken Cooper and Ted Peters specifically to simplify event-driven programming of user interfaces.
This Login Demo is very simple to understand MVVM concept.
First of all we import library in 
  implementation 'android.arch.lifecycle:extensions:1.1.1'
    implementation 'com.android.support:design:28.0.0'
    and
    to enable databindig as 
     dataBinding {
        enabled = true
    }
